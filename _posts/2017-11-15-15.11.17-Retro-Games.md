    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>When I was playing 'Chuckie Egg' I had to try really hard not to fall of the ledge, and when I did I had to try again.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I had to question myself when I was looking how many variables there were on ‘Chuckie Egg’- there were 5: the score, the player, the level, the bonus and the time remaining. Also there were 2 sprites: the ducks and the yellow man.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I used independence when I was playing the games and completing this blog. </td>
